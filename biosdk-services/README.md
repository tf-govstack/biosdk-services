# Bio SDK services

This service provides a mock implementation of Bio-SDK REST Service. It by default loads [Mock BIO SDK](https://github.com/mosip/mosip-mock-services/tree/master/mock-sdk) internally on the startup and exposes the endpoints to perform 1:N match, segmentation, extraction as per the [IBioAPI](https://github.com/mosip/commons/blob/master/kernel/kernel-biometrics-api/src/main/java/io/mosip/kernel/biometrics/spi/IBioApi.java). This can be configured to load a different JAR that has a different implementation of `IBioAPI`, provided its dependencies are in place.

## Requirements:
* Java version = 11.X.X
* Maven version >= 3.6

## Run jar directly

### Build

Go to biosdk-services folder and run the below command, this will create a jar file in target folder
```text
mvn clean install
```

### Run jar

```text
java -Dloader.path=<biosdk jar provided by third-party vendors> -Dbiosdk_bioapi_impl=<classpath of class that implements IBioApi interface> -jar biosdk-services-<version>.jar
```

For example:
```text
java -Dloader.path=mock-sdk.jar -Dbiosdk_bioapi_impl=io.mosip.mock.sdk.impl.SampleSDK -jar biosdk-services-1.1.3.jar
```

### Check service status

```

## Run as docker

### Build docker image

Build the Dockerfile to create docker image

### Run docker image

Run the docker image by providing:
* biosdk_zip_url (environment variable), url for third-party biosdk library zip file 
* biosdk_bioapi_impl (environment variable) where biosdk_zip_url is the path of the class that implements IBioApi interface methods


### Check service status
