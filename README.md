# Bio-SDK Service
This service provides a mock implementation of Bio-SDK REST Service. It by default loads [Mock BIO SDK](https://github.com/mosip/mosip-mock-services/tree/master/mock-sdk) internally on the startup and exposes the endpoints to perform 1:N match, segmentation, extraction as per the [IBioAPI](https://github.com/mosip/commons/blob/master/kernel/kernel-biometrics-api/src/main/java/io/mosip/kernel/biometrics/spi/IBioApi.java).
